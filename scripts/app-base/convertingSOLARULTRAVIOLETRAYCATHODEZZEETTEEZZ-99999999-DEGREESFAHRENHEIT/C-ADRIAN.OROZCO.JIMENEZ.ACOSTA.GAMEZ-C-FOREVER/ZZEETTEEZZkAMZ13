KeyboardJS is an easy to use keyboard wrapper. It supports the following:
◦Advanced key combos - Support for advanced combos with ordered stages.
◦Key combo overlap prevention - Prevents against bindings with shorter combos firing when another binding with a longer combo, sharing the same keys, has already been executed.
◦Macro keys - Support for adding vurtual keys backed by a key combo instead of a physical key.
◦Keyboard locales - Support for multiple locales. Comes with US locale.

Note: KeyboardJS 2 is coming soon. Checkout the next branch for a preview

Examples

Key Binding
KeyboardJS.on('a', function() {
    console.log('you pressed a!');
});

*** User presses 'a'
>>> 'you pressed a!'
*** User releases 'a'

Key Combo Binding
KeyboardJS.on('ctrl + m', function() {
    console.log('ctrl m!');
});

//note the user can press the keys in any order
*** User presses 'ctrl' and 'm'
>>> 'ctrl m!'
*** User releases 'ctrl' and 'm'

Ordered Combo Binding
KeyboardJS.on('ctrl > m', function() {
    console.log('ctrl m!');
});

*** User presses 'ctrl'
*** User presses 'm'
>>> 'ctrl m!'
*** User releases 'ctrl' and 'm'

//if the keys are pressed in the wrong order the binding will not be triggered
*** User presses 'm'
*** User presses 'ctrl'

*** User releases 'm' and 'ctrl'

Overlap Prevention
KeyboardJS.on('ctrl > m', function() {
    console.log('ctrl m!');
});
KeyboardJS.on('shift + ctrl > m', function() {
    console.log('shift ctrl m!');
});

*** User presses 'ctrl'
*** User presses 'm'
>>> 'ctrl m!'
*** User releases 'ctrl' and 'm'

//note that shift ctrl m does not trigger the ctrl m binding
*** User presses 'shift' and 'ctrl'
*** User presses 'm'
>>> 'shift ctrl m!'
*** User releases 'shift', 'ctrl' and 'm'

Methods

KeyboardJS.on

Usage
KeyboardJS.on(string keyCombo[, function onDownCallback[, function onUpCallback]]) => object binding

Binds any key or key combo. See 'keyCombo' definition below for details. The onDownCallback is fired once the key or key combo becomes active. The onUpCallback is fired when the combo no longer active (a single key is released).

Both the onDownCallback and the onUpCallback are passed three arguments. The first is the key event, the second is the keys pressed, and the third is the key combo string.

Returned

Returns an object containing the following methods.
◦clear() - Removes the key or key combo binding.
◦on() - Allows you to bind to the keyup and keydown event of the given combo. An alternative to adding the onDownCallback and onUpCallback.

KeyboardJS.activeKeys

Usage
KeyboardJS.activeKeys() => array activeKeys

Returns an array of active keys by name.

KeyboardJS.clear

Usage
KeyboardJS.clear(string keyCombo)

Removes all bindings with the given key combo. See 'keyCombo' definition for more details.

Please note that if you are just trying to remove a single binding should use the clear method in the object returned by KeyboardJS.on instead of this. This function is for removing all binding that use a certain key.

KeyboardJS.clear.key

Usage
KeyboardJS.clear.key(string keyCombo)

Removes all bindings that use the given key.

KeyboardJS.locale

Usage
KeyboardJS.locale([string localeName]) => string localeName

Changes the locale keyboardJS uses to map key presses. Out of the box KeyboardJS only supports US keyboards, however it is possible to add additional locales via KeyboardJS.locale.register().

KeyboardJS.locale.register

Usage
KeyboardJS.locale.register(string localeName, object localeDefinition)

Adds new locale definitions to KeyboardJS.

KeyboardJS.macro

Usage
KeyboardJS.macro(string keyCombo, array keyNames)

Accepts a key combo and an array of key names to inject once the key combo is satisfied.

KeyboardJS.macro.remove

Usage
KeyboardJS.macro.remove(string keyCombo)

Accepts a key combo and clears any and all macros bound to that key combo.

KeyboardJS.key.name

Usage
KeyboardJS.key.name(number keyCode) => array keyNames

Accepts a key code and returns the key names defined by the current locale.

KeyboardJS.key.code

Usage
KeyboardJS.key.code(string keyName) => number keyCode

Accepts a key name and returns the key code defined by the current locale.

KeyboardJS.combo.parse

Usage
KeyboardJS.combo.parse(string keyCombo) => array keyComboArray

Parses a key combo string into a 3 dimensional array.
◦Level 1 - sub combos.
◦Level 2 - combo stages. A stage is a set of key name pairs that must be satisfied in the order they are defined.
◦Level 3 - each key name to the stage.

KeyboardJS.combo.stringify

Usage
KeyboardJS.combo.stringify(array keyComboArray) => string KeyCombo

Stringifys a parsed key combo.

KeyboardJS.pressKey

Usage
KeyboardJS.pressKey(string keyName)

Add an active key to an array of active keys by name.

KeyboardJS.releaseKey

Usage
KeyboardJS.releaseKey(string keyName)

Removes an active key from an array of active keys by name.

Definitions

keyCombo

A string containing key names separated by whitespace, >, +, and ,.

examples
◦'a' - binds to the 'a' key. Pressing 'a' will match this keyCombo.
◦'a, b' - binds to the 'a' and 'b' keys. Pressing either of these keys will match this keyCombo.
◦'a + b' - binds to the 'a' and 'b' keys. Pressing both of these keys will match this keyCombo.
◦'a + b, c + d' - binds to the 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' keys. Pressing either the 'a' key and the 'b' key, or the 'c' and the 'd' key will match this keyCombo.

localeDefinitions

An object that maps keyNames to their keycode and stores locale specific macros. Used for mapping keys on different locales.

example
{
    "map": {
        "65": ["a"],
        "66": ["b"],
        ...
    },
    "macros": [
        ["shift + `", ["tilde", "~"]],
        ["shift + 1", ["exclamation", "!"]],
        ...
    ]
}

keyboardJS can support any locale:wlan0a.iadrian.o.j.a.g bina new locale is easy. Map your keyboard to an object and pass it to KeyboardJS.locale.register('myLocale', {/localeDefinition/}) then call KeyboardJS.locale('myLocale').

How to install TP-Link TL-WN725N on Raspberry Pi | Laurent Hinoul☑

Helped me a lot, after a long search for a solution. I could not believe that "wlan0″ appeared in the wpa-gui. Of course it is required to follow the code precisely and use the correct data for your own Linux version provided by Raspberry Pi (see Laurents link).

Physically: what is the wlan0/wlan1 antenna - Mark V - Hak5 Forums☑

How ever - when using the box for that scenario, there is no need to have both hardware antennas of wlan0 and wlan1 attached to the MARK V. It may sound stupid, but ... is the antenna near the sd card slot wlan0 oder wlan1 - I don't see any identification???

Connecting Centos 6 Linux to a wifi network with a WEP key☑

Once you have identified your wireless interface card, you need to create a file called ifcfg-wlan0 in /etc/sysconfig/network. The part in the filename that says "wlan0" needs to correspond with the name of your wireless interface card, usually this will be "wlan0".

If you want to run a webserver on the Gnublin board and connect to it with a smartphone or a browser or if you want to send some data to a server you need a connection to the internet. If you won't use a cable to connect to the internet, WLAN is an optimal solution to connect to the internet.

This example assumes that your server has an eth0 connection to the network and wlan0 which is being used as the wireless AP. First we need to install the bridge utilities: user@computer:$ sudo apt-get install bridge-utils.

In the President's State of the Union address, he told homeowners that if they refinanced at today's historically low rates, they could save upto $3,000. This statement can be found in the State of the Union transcript - http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/24/remarks-president-state-union-address. Additionally, homeowners who refinance from 30 year fixed mortgages to 15 year fixed mortgages can save up to $145,000. Further information for this can be found at http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/realestate/exploring-the-15-year-loan-for-refinancing-mortgages.html

Under provisions of the Making Homes Affordable Act(a.k.a. HARP 2.0), signed into law by President Obama, Fannie Mae has removed certain loan refinance requirements for qualifying loans including the Loan-To-Value (LTV) ceiling for fixed-rate mortgage, property appraisal, minimum credit score & credit check, and eliminated & lowered certain fees for borrowers making it easier to refinance into a lower rate mortgage, effectively reducing the amount of interest paid (and owed) over the life of the loan.More info: http://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac-Announce-HARP-Changesto-Reach-More-Borrowers.aspx

A shorter term mortgage enables such borrowers to pay down the amount they owe much faster than a traditional 30-year mortgage. Furthermore, interest rates on shorter term mortgages usually are less than on thirty-year mortgages. More information can be found at http://harpprogram.org/faq.php 

The Making Home Affordable Program is set to expire December 31, 2015 and is free http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/about-mha/Pages/default.aspx but standard refinance fees will still apply.
